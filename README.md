In this programming assignment, you will implement graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS) and
the algorithm to compute Strongly Connected Components. This assignment has two parts. In the
first part, you will use BFS to implement a crawler to crawl and discover the wikipedia graph. In
the second part, you will implement algorithm to compute strongly connected components (SCC).
